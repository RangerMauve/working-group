[Meeting notes](https://github.com/datprotocol/working-group/blob/master/meeting-notes/03-07feb2018.md)

## General Notes

- Decided to use "Hypercore feed" in last meeting
- dat protocol connection terms; channel vs feed
    - 'channel' is part of the wire implementations
    - Channels on the wire can be reused by other feeds
    - channels are way to multiplex connection
    - TABLED for discussion in DEP
- peers connected terms; syncing, connected, swarming, seeding, etc.
    - how is seeding used in BT
    - syncing, connectecd, swarming, seeding
    - when you join the discovery network and transact with lots of peers, youre 'swarming'
    - when two peers connect, they 'sync' the data
    - the state a client can be in when it's "done synchronizing", but it isn't actually done and is waiting for potential new versions
        - "actively idle", syncing but idle
        - the distinction between the writer, which could be said to be "seeding", a peer only downloading most recent and stopping ("replicating"?), and a persistent peer ("swarming")
    - be explicit about different states
    - propose that a persistent peer is "seeding" whether they are the author or not
    - there's the distinction between the writer, which could be said to be "seeding", a peer only downloading most recent and stopping ("replicating"?), and a persistent peer ("swarming")
    - the action between 2 connected peers ("sync" ?) the action of being on the discovery network and syncing ("swarming" ?) the action of being a persistent peer ("seeding" ?) the action of a temporary peer that partially replicates (?)
- "entries" within a single hypercore feed name
    - in the hypercore DEP, I've called them "entry"
    - and I've call the numbers "revisions"
    - mafintosh calls block, because its atomic unit of system
    - consensus towards block
- revision, index, etc: numbering system
    - index
    - revision ("rev")
    - sequence
    - with multiwriter it might be 'revision' for one feed and 'revision vector' for all
    - feed numbers are unresolved, looking at 'revision'
- there is a bit of nomenclature ambiguity whether SLEEP means individual files or the collection of files hypercore uses
- multiwriter, hyperdb + multiwriter is one go but integrating it will be two
    - one pr to that add hyperdb single writer. Another one that exposes multiwriter
    - first PR to hyperdrive will have no backward compat at all then discuss from there


## Decisions Made

- defer on name of `hypercore feed __s` (block vs entry) pending discussion/thinking
- defer on name of 'revision' or 'version'
- defer on voting of moving dep 0001 to final state
