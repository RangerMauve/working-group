#### Action Item Review:

* (skipping DEPs/security updates)
* No update on heartbeat
* Dat DNS todos done
* hypercore data-structure identification headers
    * Current approach is that all known data structures should follow the 1st message is a header message structure
    * We need a DEP for that. It's pretty basic

## Meeting Notes

    * If this lands we should start having a list of official extensions btw

* AGENDA ITEM: Discuss Ephemeral Message Extension DEP
    * https://github.com/datprotocol/DEPs/pull/28
    * Mafinosh: idea here is good. But there are things I'd like to change
    * Consider security
    * And having a basic sequence number on them so they could be forwarded
    * discuss more in GH PR
    * Also you should consider having it be a protobuf, Easier to extend and not introduce a new encoding format
    * Or making the header a varint for consistency

## Decisions Made

* List extensions somewhere on datprotocol.com (TBD)

## ACTION ITEMS

* Hypercore data-structure headers
    * DEP: all known data structures should follow the 1st message is a header message structure
