## Summary/Review of meeting 4

* [Meeting notes](https://github.com/datprotocol/working-group/blob/master/meeting-notes/03-21feb2018.md)
* [action items](https://github.com/datprotocol/working-group/issues/7)

#### Action Item Review:

* DEP review
    * hyperdb:<bnewbold_> made progress on hyperdb. biggest confusion to me still is around deletions
    * <bnewbold_> I have some open questions (to be answered offline)
    * multi-writer started, not ready for review/feedback yet, hope to have that in the next day or two
    * hyperdrive: I'm going to work in that feedback, then mafintosh I'll punt it to you
* language around "channels" in the wire protocol
    * let's keep that decision/discussion a part of the wire protocol and leave it then
* DNS: bryan sync with maf (I presume) about DNS server
    * got working, has questions about config

## General Notes

* DNS:
    * currently use publicbits.org, switch to datprotocol.com
        * long transfer period
    * some kind of round-robin DNS? or generally a way to discover the nearest/fastest DNS server?
* AGENDA ITEM: decide on block vs entry discussion
    * hypercore feed entry / hypercore feed block
    * consensus to entry
* AGENDA ITEM: nomenclature ambiguity whether SLEEP means individual files or the collection of files hypercore uses
    * bnewbold_: propose we try to disambiguate with "SLEEP file" to refer to the individual files and "SLEEP directory" for the whole thing
    * <bnewbold_> and not ambiguously refer to "SLEEP format"
    *  I won't update the whitepaper, but when we do the DEP we can use the above terminology
* AGENDA ITEM: how to handle breaking changes, specifically how the version used by a hypercore/drive is signaled
    * 

## Decisions Made

- currently use publicbits.org, switch to datprotocol.com
- use "entry" for hypercore entry, log entry, etc.
- use SLEEP file and SLEEP directory

## ACTION ITEMS

* Change DNS to use datprotocol.com
    * TODO: what things need to happen for this?
    * update dat-swarm-defaults
    * change DNS (joe owns datprotocol.com)
    * ???
* Next meeting:
    * discuss idea of moving metadata from dat.json to this data
    * standardizing the protocol for registries (dat publish)
